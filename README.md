# winscripts #

Collection of Windows Batch and Powershell scripts. I add more from time to
time.

## Setup ##

The Batch files should run fine under every version of Windows CMD since Windows
XP. The Powershell scripts should be compatible with the newest version of
Powershell. The scripts can be directly executed in Windows either from the
explorer or the respective command line.

## Origin ##

The files in this repository used to be part of my main configuration repository
[nekoconfig](https://github.com/catlinman/nekoconfig) which contained everything
from skins to configurations files over to scripts. It has since been split off
into this separate repository which was started from scratch. This means that
for any previous commits made to the files in this repository before November
2017 you should have a look at the original repository over at
[nekoconfig-origin](https://github.com/catlinman/nekoconfig-origin).
